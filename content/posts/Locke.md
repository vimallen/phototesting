Situated in central Kensington, Ember Locke typifies contemporary luxury with a hotel experience that blends contemporary luxury with rich, layered interiors. Designed by Atelier Ochre in collaboration with House of Dre, the hotel’s design transports guests into an opulent yet inviting space, brimming with texture, colour, and artistic detail.

The interiors at Ember Locke are a masterclass in materiality, featuring recycled velvets and boucle fabrics, handcrafted wooden details, and jewel-toned surfaces. Deep teal walls, warm wood panelling, and tactile upholstery create a moody yet welcoming atmosphere, enhanced by the interplay of soft drapery, vintage-inspired lighting, and sculptural furniture pieces. A host of local artists’ work is also displayed throughout the property.
